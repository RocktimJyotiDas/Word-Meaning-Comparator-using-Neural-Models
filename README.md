# Word-Meaning-Comparator-using-Neural-Models
Words often have multiple meanings associated with them and the surrounding context often
determines the specific meaning of the word which is used. The goal of this assignment is to
develop deep neural models that can identify whether a particular word used in a sentence pair
has the same meaning in both sentences or has a different meaning in each of the sentences.<br />
For example,<br />
S1: We often used to play on the bank of the river<br />
S2: We lived along the bank of the Ganges.<br />
S3: He cashed a check at the bank<br />
S1 and S2 use the same meaning of the word bank (river bed) while S1 and S3 use different
meanings of the word bank (river bed vs. financial institution)
